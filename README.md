- 👋 Hi, I’m @swatilatthwal
-  👀 I’m interested in Data Science in Supply Chain

## 🐍 Python
I am proficient in Python, the leading programming language in data science, known for its simplicity and powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. I utilize TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn for building machine learning models, particularly for predictive analytics and automation in supply chain operations.

## 📊 R
My expertise extends to R, a language favored for its robust statistical analysis capabilities and graphical tools. I frequently use packages such as `forecast` and `ggplot2` for forecasting demand and analyzing supply chain trends, making data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency.

## 🗃️ SQL
I rely on SQL to manage and analyze large volumes of data typical in supply chains. My SQL skills help in querying relational databases effectively, crucial for efficient data management and in-depth analysis within the supply chain context.


- 🌱 I’m Currently Learning

I am deepening my expertise in database design, focusing on creating efficient schemas in Databricks to streamline data ingestion into data lakes. My current studies involve implementing SQL queries within the Databricks environment to develop smooth data pipelines. This work is aimed at enhancing data accessibility and simplifying the extraction process, ensuring that data is not only stored effectively but is also readily available for analysis and decision-making.

- 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On

I am eager to collaborate on various supply chain optimization projects that encompass transportation, procurement, demand planning, and network planning. My focus is on leveraging statistical analysis to optimize the flow of items from manufacturers to customers. I aim to build predictive models that not only track item movements effectively but also enhance the overall customer experience. I'm particularly interested in projects where innovative data-driven strategies can significantly improve efficiency, accuracy, and end-user satisfaction in the supply chain process.
